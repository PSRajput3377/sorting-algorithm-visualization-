# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer üéØ


This is a **sorting algorithm visualization tool** built using **Python and Pygame**. The application allows you to visually understand how popular sorting algorithms like **Quick Sort**, **Bubble Sort**, **Merge Sort**, etc., work step by step.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This is currently a **desktop application** that requires Python and Pygame to run. The goal is to convert this into a fully browser-based website soon!

üöÄ How to Run
Clone the repository


git clone https://github.com/PSRajput3377/sorting-algorithm-visualization-.git
