Introduction
Sorting Algorithm Visualization is a web-based tool designed to help users understand and 
compare different sorting algorithms through visual animations.
It showcases popular sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, 
and more, illustrating how each algorithm works and their time complexities.

Features
Visual representation of multiple sorting algorithms
Step-by-step explanation and visualization
Real-time adjustment of array size and sorting speed
Interactive controls for play, pause, and reset
Algorithm comparison with time complexity analysis

Getting Started
To set up and run the sorting algorithm visualization project using Pygame, follow these steps.

1.Python (3.6 or later)
2.Pygame


download python latest version from
https://www.python.org/

install pygame using command in terminal
